Tipper
==================

Tip Calculator app for CodePath

Time spent: 40 hours total (20+ hours was spent on implementing cost breakdown per person, which required two more views and extra math calculations. This was not required, but I really wanted to implement it.)

Completed user stories:

* [x] Required: Basic tip calculator functionatliy
* [x] Required: Settings page
* [x] Optional: Remember the bill amount across app restarts (within 60 seconds)
* [x] Optional: Use locale specific currency and currency thousands separators
* [x] Additional: Showing both pre-tax and after-tax bill amounts. Both are editable fields.
* [x] Additional: Cost breakdown per person
